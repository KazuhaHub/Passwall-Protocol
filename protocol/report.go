// second hard constraint is that an agent reports "I applied version N", never
// "this is my config" — because the latter is something PSP would swallow as a
// new desired value, at which point confirmation degenerates into PSP agreeing
// with itself. That constraint is usually a discipline; here it is a property
// of the type, checkable by reading the struct.
//
// The same rule closes ADR 0025 debt 3(d) at the protocol boundary: a health
// probe's target host and port may only come from the desired document, so
// there is nowhere in this message to put them.

	// Capabilities are an allowlist for optional behaviour in this exact
	// report. PSP dispatches a task only when both task.execution.v1 and the
	// task-kind capability are present; absence therefore fails closed for
	// older and partially upgraded agents.
	Capabilities []string `json:"capabilities,omitempty"`

	// Partial says this report OMITTED the enumerations — Objects,
	// ListenerCounters, Clients and Subjects — and carries only Have (plus any
	// Issues). It exists so the poll
	// cadence and the report cadence can differ: a fleet polling every few
	// seconds for low delivery latency must not ship a full per-client counter
	// enumeration every few seconds.
	//
	// FALSE IS THE SAFE DEFAULT, AND THAT IS WHY THE FLAG IS NAMED FOR THE
	// EXCEPTION. An agent that does not know this field sends false, and false
	// means "full", which means the strict rule below applies. The two possible
	// mistakes are not symmetric:
	//
	//   - a light report misread as full  -> every client is missing -> a loud,
	//     visible, self-correcting false alarm.
	//   - a full report misread as light  -> a genuinely missing client is
	//     silently swallowed, and the check stops checking with nothing on
	//     screen to say so.
	//
	// The second is the failure this whole protocol is written against, so the
	// zero value must land on the first.
	//
	// On a partial report PSP updates NOTHING from the absent fields: it must
	// not read empty Objects as "everything converged", and it must not read
	// empty Clients as zero traffic.
	Partial bool `json:"partial"`

	// Have is what the agent currently holds per stream. The validators live in
	// the BODY, in one place — not in HTTP conditional headers. §8.3: those
	// headers are defined on GET, this is a POST that never returns 304, so
	// middleware and proxies would not treat them as intended; and a header
	// plus a body field would be two writers of one fact with no precedence
	// rule between them.
	Have map[string]StreamState `json:"have"`

	// Objects is per-object convergence. What is ATOMIC is the desired-state
	// commit, not runtime convergence — so accepted-version and per-object
	// status are separate fields and are ALLOWED to disagree.
	Objects []ObjectStatus `json:"objects"`

	// ListenerCounters is the FULL cumulative listener-counter enumeration. PSP's node
	// traffic charts are sourced from listener counters, never by summing shared
	// clients (which would double-count a client attached to several listeners).
	ListenerCounters []ListenerCounters `json:"listener_counters"`

	// Clients is a FULL enumeration INCLUDING ZERO VALUES. On a report with
	// Partial=false, absence from this list is a protocol issue, never idleness.
	// (On a partial report the field is absent wholesale and says nothing; see
	// Partial above for why the flag defaults to the strict reading.)
	//
	// §7.3 records the upstream implementation this guards against: V2bX skips
	// the whole report when no traffic moved and drops users below a threshold,
	// so "the reporter died" and "nobody used this node" became the same
	// observation. PSP cannot absorb that either — its poll short-circuits on a
	// zero delta and writes neither lifetime nor baseline.
	Clients []ClientCounters `json:"clients"`

	// Subjects carries the shadow concurrency evaluation. Empty in a build that
	// has not implemented it; that is distinguishable from all-zeros.
	Subjects []SubjectObservation `json:"subjects,omitempty"`

	// Host is the OPTIONAL host telemetry. Its absence is always legal and never
	// means zero: it means the build has no collector, or this round was not due
	// for one, or the collection failed as a whole. A panel that reads an absent
	// Host as "everything is at zero" would show a healthy-looking idle machine,
	// and one that deletes the last valid snapshot on it would erase the only
	// evidence of what the host looked like before it went dark.
	//
	// It is NOT part of the durable outbox. Telemetry is best-effort observation
	// that is regenerated every interval; replaying it after a reconnect would
	// deliver a stale machine's numbers as if they were current. The panel
	// tolerates a gap rather than making the data plane wait for a metric.
	Host *HostObservation `json:"host,omitempty"`

	// Issues are conditions the agent cannot reconcile by itself. This is

	// but to record a stable code and hand it to a person.
	Issues []Issue `json:"issues,omitempty"`
