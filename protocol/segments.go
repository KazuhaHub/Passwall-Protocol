	//
	// THE POINTER is what carries the tri-state, and dropping it is the
	// dangerous edit: as a plain int64, 0 would mean both "exhausted" and "not
	// configured" — the exact collision traffic_cap.go already has, where

	// So it would not collapse the tri-state; it would turn `"headroom_bytes":
	// null` into an absent key, and both still decode to nil. What it costs is
	// wire explicitness: null visibly says "PSP decided there is no limit",
	// where a missing key reads like a gap. On a field this load-bearing that is
	// worth keeping, but it is a debuggability property, not a correctness one.

	// At PeriodEndsAtMS the agent sets BaselineBytes to its current counter,

	// exhausted" — and must not arrive as "no schedule".
